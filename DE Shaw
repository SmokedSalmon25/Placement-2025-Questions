Question 1 — Minimum Bit Flips to Make All Elements Equal

You are given an array of positive integers.
You are allowed to flip bits in any element — meaning you can change a 0 bit to 1 or a 1 bit to 0 in its binary representation.
Your goal is to make all elements in the array equal.
Find the minimum number of individual bit flips required to achieve this.

Question 2 — Minimum Swaps

You are given an array that contains at least one zero and some positive numbers.
In a single move, you may swap exactly one zero with soem other element.
Your goal is to rearrange the array so that:
1. All positive numbers come first,
2. Those positive numbers are in ascending order, and
3. All zeros are at the end.
Find the minimum number of allowed swaps needed to reach such an arrangement.


Question 3 — Count the Number of Good Subarrays

A subarray is called good if the following condition holds:
If the subarray has odd length, it is automatically good.
If the subarray has even length, then after sorting that subarray, the two middle elements must be equal.
Given an array, count how many subarrays are good.

Question 1: Express a number as sum of 2 powers of 2, algorithm and is it possible
Example, 9 would be 2^0+2^3

Question 2: algorithm for given a number of digits eg 21, find the largest possible 21 digit special number
Criterion for a number being special: if 1 occurs it occurs one, if 4 is used it has to occur 4 times
examples of special numbers: 515555, 32323
