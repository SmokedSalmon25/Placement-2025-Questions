## Questions

1. Given an array of fruits. Each fruit is discounted by an amount:  
   `discounted_price[i] = arr[i] - (first element on the right lesser than it)`.  
   If no element on the right is smaller, there is no discount.  
   Calculate the total discounted price.

2. For a number `n` (e.g. `6` in binary is `110`) – define `f(n)` as the number with the same number of digits in binary but all ones  
   (e.g. `f(6) = 111 = 7`).  
   Find the number of numbers excluding `n` that are **less than `f(n)`** and have the **same number of 1’s in binary as `n`**.

3. Given an integer array `A` of size `n (1e5)`, partition it into `k (1 ≤ k ≤ n)` contiguous non-empty subarrays such that when you take the **maximum element from each subarray** and sum them up, this total sum is **as small as possible**.

4. DSU – union by size, output the size of each component.

5. Given two strings `x` and `y`, return the length of the **longest subsequence of `x`** that is also a **substring of `y`**.
