## Interview

### Quant Strategist

1. 30 red, 20 blue, 10 green balls – what is the probability that when the last red is removed, green and blue are left
2. 100 ants randomly dropped on stick in random direction, 101st ant in center, infected, when ants collide, infected ant infects the other, both turn, expected number of infected ants
3. n × n grid, rows are sorted, columns are sorted, search for a key (O(n))
4. Is 1000343 prime
5. 100 noodles, joining ends, expected number of loops
6. N rolls of dice, probability that numbers we get are in non-decreasing order
7. Convert biased coin to unbiased. On average how many tosses to finish? Modify strategy when p = 1/3 to reduce expected number of flips
